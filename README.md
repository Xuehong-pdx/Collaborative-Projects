# Coloborative-Projects

The scope

Phase I:

This project aims to derive insights from health related data.The file "County_Health_Rankings.csv" downloaded from Tableau data source contains missing data in multiple columns as well as duplicated records.  It was migrated into Postgres database as a table.

A cleaned table "Cleaned_Health_Rankings" is also stored in the database.  Both data files are uploaded to this repository.

Phase II

Economic and other types of data will be integrated as new tables in the database to create a comprehensive data source for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis will be performed on the data to focus the direction of the project.

Phase III

Predictive analysis will be performed to derive actionable insights.
